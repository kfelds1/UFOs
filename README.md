# UFOs

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to create an interactive webpage in which a user can find information about UFO sightings based on certain criteria. The user has the ability to filter the UFO table by date, city, state, country, or shape in order to learn about their desired UFO sightings.




## Summary

A drawback to the design is that the user cannot simply put any specific item as part of their criteria. If that datapoint is not in the dataset to begin with, then the user will not be able to search for it. For example, the user might not know if Boston is part of the data, so they would have to scroll the entire table before narrowing down their search.

One potential solution to this problem is to create a drop-down list of all data for each topic so the user could see beforehand what they will actually be able to search for. Another solution to this problem might be for the user to have an option to not only filter the data, but to sort the data. Perhaps they would want to sort the sightings from longest to shortest in terms of duration. This feature would allow the user to have an even more choices on how they want to view the UFO sightings data.
